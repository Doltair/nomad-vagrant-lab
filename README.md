# HashiCorp Nomad - 3-Node Local Lab 

## What is this?

A simple 3-node lab running Ubuntu servers on VirtualBox and each node runs Consul and Nomad servers which can be configured as a cluster.

## Why use this method?

This is a great way to get your feet wet with Nomad in a simplified environment and you also have a chance to mess around with the configurations and commands without risking a cloud (read: money) installation or a production (read: danger!) environment.

## Requirements

There are a few things you need to get this going:

* Vagrant

* VirtualBox

## How to use the 3-node lab configuraiton

* Clone this repo (or fork it of you so desire and want to contribute to it)

* Change directory and run a `vagrant status` to check the dependencies are met

* Run a `vagrant up` command and watch the magic happen! (spoiler alert: it's not magic, it's technology)

## Interacting with the Nomad and Consul cluster


* You can use some simple commands to get started 
```
nomad node status
```
